# Overview
In this Challenge i uses Python and SQLAlchemy 
to query a SQLite file containing weather 
data. I analyzed 
the data with the aim of 
understanding how best to build a surf 
shop company. This analysis contains two parts. 
First, I determined the temperatures we 
can expect  in June. Second, 
I ran the same analysis for the month of December.
The first step of the analysis was
 connecting to the SQLite database

 # conclusion
 The temperatures in December 
  are only slightly colder and slightly more 
  variable than in June.
